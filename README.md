# CE4145-NLP-Comparative-Evaluation
Divyaman Shrestha (1811783)

This project performs a comparative evaluation of two NLP approaches 
(TF-IDF models vs SBERT models) using the IMDB movie reviews dataset. 
The notebook includes preprocessing, representation learning, model 
training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation and visualisation.

The IMDB dataset is too large to upload directly to GitHub (over 25MB), so it is provided via an external link.

Download the dataset here:

When running the notebook in Google Colab, upload the CSV file manually using the file upload button in Colab.  
It will appear under `/content/`, which matches the path used in the notebook:

To run, open google colab or any other form you would prefer and run all the cells

Installation:

pip install -r requirements.txt
